Short answer: he / him.

The long answer is much more complicated, and actually comes down to the question being incorrect.

While I feel comfortable being adressed with male pronouns, I think the world would be better of if we don't assign a gramatical gender to people. 
I'd be quite happy if we refer to all people as they/them. 

I'd be quite happy if we stop asking people to fill out their gender on every form. 

**** forms that ask for religion or race??

## Aren't you trying to change the language itself?

Yes, of course I am.  In the George Orwell novel 1984, "Newspeak" was be used by the government to control 
the masses. What we need now is the opposite a grassroots movement to make small modifications to our languages. Small modification to include and empower people. 

The problem in English is a relatively small one since it doesn't have gendered nouns. 
The job title of a police officer, principle, administrator or physician are grammatically gender neutral. 
Because most words are gender neutral, those few words that are gender specific stand out even more (chairman, postman, "madam vice-president").
Still, in languages like Spanish most words change grammatical gender depending on the person: ***Juan es médico y María es médica.***. 
One possible solution is to use the grammatical male form and designate it as the gender-neutral form. 
For example, the French have started using the phrase "madame le directeur" rather than the traditional female word "directrice".

There is a lot of work to be done changing each language to be inclusive and gender neutral. Sadly, the burden 
to propose different words and grammatical constructs will lie with the people affected. 
Transgender, intersex, non-binary and gender-fluid people will have to come together and lead the way on this addition to our languages.
An important part of their task will be to communicate in a positive way and to spread love even when they receive hate.
That way, they will be able to change society as a whole. Note that the *goal* is not to change the language. The goal is to change the way we think and act: in a more loving and inclusive way.

## Isn't this a political debate?

Yes, this is political. It is about human rights, which is a political debate. Anybody can try and restrict 
the right of other people or groups of people. In fact, many groups and people in power have restricted and will
continue to restrict the rights of others. 
There was outrage when commoners in (people who were not nobility) England and France asserted their political rights, 
and again when women and people of color claimed equal rights. We are a long way from "all people being treated equally". 
And as a white, privileged heterosexual cis-man, I am forever indebted to all the women and to all the black, latino, 
asian, arab, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, gay, queer people, 
to people who deviate from what some consider the physical or mental "norm", 
and to all people of minorities who put themselves out there to fight for the inclusion and equal treatment of everybody.
