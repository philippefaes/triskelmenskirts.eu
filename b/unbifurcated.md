Bifurcation is a fancy word that means splits (forks) into two (bi) parts. A road can bifurcate.
Pants are an example of bifurcating clothes. You could call all clothes that are not pants **unbifurcated** clothes.

I've first read the term MUG (male unbifurcated gear, or men's unbifurcated garnment) on the website of Macabi skirt, but it is being used on other websites as well.

Dresses, skirts, gowns, kilts, sarongs, thawbs, cassock, izaar ... are all unbifuracted clothes. 

So get your MUG and join the unbifurcated lifestyle!
