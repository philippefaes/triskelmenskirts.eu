Manifesto

* We assert the right of men to express our tears so that we can heal.
* We assert the right of men to express their rage so that we can learn to control it.
* We assert the right of men to wear the clothing of their choice
* We assert that while our sisters are not the same as us, they are equal to us.


* We strive to be wise men.
* We strive to be honest men.
* We strive to be brave men.
